# replayable-web-quiz

Ever wanted to do intense js knowledge training? There are few guides and few tests, but once you've done them, they are of no use, just because now you remember all answers, and test result will be not valid.

There are a plenty of js/web quizes and tests on the internet, but all of them have one problem: you can't redo them later to see how your expertise had grown. The project intends to make question generation automated.

So instead of specifying a one time use list of questions and aswers, we specify just choose:

1. What content areas should questions cover. Example: plain javascript, angular, html, css.
2. What features should questions cover. Example: javascript scopes, javascript comma operator, angular services, html flex, css specifity.
3. A degree of misleading. For example, how many false suggestions should be proposed.

Personally I dislike a misleading questions, because they test not skill but perception and attention, but some companies may employ such tests, so we need place to train them.
